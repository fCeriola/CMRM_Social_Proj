    <p> We wanted to go inside the pitch detection topic applied to the chord recognition, 
        so we elaborated a web-app that uses a Chromogram function in order to retrieve songs chords. 
    The entire analysis process is made up in phyton.</p>
 
    <p>We explored the topic finding out that there are many parameters to tune in order to obtain
        a correct representation of the chords. Because the algorythm could fail or be imprecise, we implemented
        a system in which every user can send a feedback through a comment in the "post" section, like a social network.
