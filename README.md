We wanted to go inside the pitch detection topic applied to chord recognition, so we elaborated a web app that uses a Chromogram function in order to retrieve songs chords. The entire analysis process is made in phyton.

We explored the topic finding out that there are many parameters to tune in order to obtain a correct representation of the chords. Because the algorithm could fail or be imprecise, we implemented a system in which every user can send feedback through a comment in the "post" section, like a social network.
