            <p> <b>"Need Chords?"</b>  is a web app that allows you to retrieve chords from file. You have only to access with Google, go into the account page and upload a song. 
                Once you have uploaded it, press the "Need Chords" button and the system will automatically give you all the triades with the relative timestamps.
            </p>
    
            <p>However, the algorhytm is not perfect, so the system may declare that some chords are imprecise or even wrong. 
                This is how the app become a <b>social media</b>. It is up to you to eventually start a pool, asking to the other connected users
                to send a feedback. You can also set how many answer you need to complete the pool in the specific format provided.</p>
